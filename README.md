# SMBGhost (CVE-2020-0796) Automate Exploitation and Detection

This python program is a wrapper from the RCE SMBGhost vulnerability. All the credits for the working exploit to [chompie1337][1]. All the credits for the scanner to [ioncodes][2].

I just automate these functions in one program. You need to have in mind the architecture of the Windows target when you are going to create the reverse shell.

This exploit is not **stable**, use at your own. Sometimes it doesn't work at the first time, this is why I added a second retry.

If you are going to put your own shellcode, have in mind that the shellcode max size is **600 bytes**.

* Tested on Windows 10 x64 (Microsoft Windows [Versi√≥n 10.0.18362.113]. Build 1903.)
* Tested on Win10 Enterprise (Eng) x64 v1903 Build 18362.30
